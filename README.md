Many thanks, GA! This class was great. 

If I had more time, a few things I would continue to tinker on here: 
- Add responsive elements and media queries
- Fix the frame, or replace with a border than sizes dynamically to the image called from the array
- Make it so the form fully validates responses. I feel like I was getting close! You can probably tell in the code that I was playing around with variables and console logging everything. I think the sticking point was the form function trying to point to variables in the image switcher.

At any rate, this was fun to work on, even if I didn't get it completely perfect.
